In the Irrlicht Engine, everything can be found in the namespace 'irr'. So if
you want to use a class of the engine, you have to write irr:: before the name
of the class. For example to use the IrrlichtDevice write: irr::IrrlichtDevice.
To get rid of the irr:: in front of the name of every class, we tell the
compiler that we use that namespace from now on, and we will not have to write
irr:: anymore.

There are 5 sub namespaces in the Irrlicht Engine. Take a look at them, you can
read a detailed description of them in the documentation by clicking on the top
menu item 'Namespace List' or by using this link:
http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/docu/namespaces.html
Like the irr namespace, we do not want these 5 sub namespaces now, to keep this
example simple. Hence, we tell the compiler again that we do not want always to
write their names.

To be able to use the Irrlicht.DLL file, we need to link with the Irrlicht.lib.
We could set this option in the project settings, but to make it easy, we use a
pragma comment lib for VisualStudio. On Windows platforms, we have to get rid
of the console window, which pops up when starting a program with main(). This
is done by the second pragma. We could also use the WinMain method, though
losing platform independence then.

	The most important function of the engine is the createDevice()
	function. The IrrlichtDevice is created by it, which is the root
	object for doing anything with the engine. createDevice() has 7
	parameters:

	- deviceType: Type of the _device. This can currently be the Null-_device,
	   one of the two software renderers, D3D8, D3D9, or OpenGL. In this
	   example we use EDT_SOFTWARE, but to try out, you might want to
	   change it to EDT_BURNINGSVIDEO, EDT_NULL, EDT_DIRECT3D8,
	   EDT_DIRECT3D9, or EDT_OPENGL.

	- windowSize: Size of the Window or screen in FullScreenMode to be
	   created. In this example we use 640x480.

	- bits: Amount of color bits per pixel. This should be 16 or 32. The
	   parameter is often ignored when running in windowed mode.

	- fullscreen: Specifies if we want the _device to run in fullscreen mode
	   or not.

	- stencilbuffer: Specifies if we want to use the stencil buffer (for
	   drawing shadows).

	- vsync: Specifies if we want to have vsync enabled, this is only useful
	   in fullscreen mode.

	- eventReceiver: An object to receive events. We do not want to use this
	   parameter here, and set it to 0.

	Always check the return value to cope with unsupported drivers,
	dimensions, etc.
